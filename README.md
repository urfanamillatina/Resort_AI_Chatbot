## Business Problem
Mountain Universe Resort is a all-inclusive, well-known boutique ski resort in Switzerland. They had received inquires 24/7 about new reservations, rescheduling and cancellations, and frequently asked questions about the resorts itself such as their amenities, rooms, restaurants, etc. Having an AI chatbot to do these tasks would help Mountain Universe resort to reduce repetitive manual tasks and increase conversion booking rate by having this seamless reservation experience, especially during outside local working hours.


## The Development Stages

#### Fun Fact!
I chose the name Mountain Universe and MU Bot to match my initial MU! üòù

## The Chatbot Workflows

MU Bot has three  main workflows which are:

1. Make new reservations; 
2. Manage their reservations: canceling or rescheduling;
3. Resort Information: answer FAQ about the resort, such as its amenities, restaurants and cafe, rooms and contact information.
